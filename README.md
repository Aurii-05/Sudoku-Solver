# Sudoku-Solver
I get stuck on Sudoku sometime... why not use my computer to solve it? :)

To use simply enter your Sudoku grid row by row, with no seperating spaces, as in Row 1 Col 0-9 then Row 2 Col 0-9. Blank spaces should be entered as 0. Nothing too complex, just fun if you are stuck on a problem.
